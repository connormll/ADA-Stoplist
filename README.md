# ADA-Stoplist
Stoplist of words for judicial opinions on the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Created for use in my [undergraduated honors thesis research](https://github.com/connormll/Honors-Thesis-ADA-project). Generated from analyzing the frequency of words in ~5,000 Appellate and District Court opinions. The opinions analyzed were **only** regarding reasonable accomodation claims, so it might not perfectly fit all ADA opinions.
